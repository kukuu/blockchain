# Open Banking API implementation

## Scenario:
 A third-party financial app wants to access a user's account information from a bank securely. 

## Solution Design:
The API can be designed using RESTful principles and utilize OAuth 2.0 for authentication and authorization. 
The outcome will enable secure data exchange between banks and third-party financial Apps.

### Implementation steps :

#### API Endpoints and Authentication:

- The API can have endpoints to retrieve account information, transaction history, and other financial data.
For authentication, the third-party app must first register with the bank and obtain a client ID and client secret.
When a user authorizes the third-party app, the app exchanges the client ID and secret for an access token from the bank's OAuth server.

#### Authorization and Scopes:

- The API should define different scopes for various data access levels (e.g., "accounts:read", "transactions:read").
During the OAuth flow, the third-party app requests specific scopes based on the user's consent.

#### Access Token and Token Expiry:

The access token is included in the API requests' Authorization header, ensuring secure data transmission.
Access tokens should have a limited lifespan, and the API should provide a refresh token to obtain a new access token when it expires.

#### Data Encryption and Security:

All sensitive data transmitted between the third-party app and the API should be encrypted using HTTPS.
The API should implement strong security measures to protect against common attacks like CSRF and XSS.

#### API Rate Limiting and Throttling:

Implement rate limiting and throttling mechanisms to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API.


#### Error Handling and API Responses:

The API should provide meaningful error responses, including proper HTTP status codes and error messages.

#### Monitoring and Logging:

Set up logging and monitoring to track API usage, performance, and potential issues.
