# White Paper

## Blockchain

By storing data across its network, the blockchain eliminates the risks that come with data being processed and held centrally.

Its network lacks centralized points of vulnerability that computer hackers can exploit. Today’s internet has security problems that are familiar to everyone. We all rely on the “username/password” system to protect our identity and assets online. Blockchain security methods use encryption technology.

With Blockchain, users to the network have private keys and the network stores public keys for encryption/decryption when called upon.

#### Technologies
Adopting and integrating these technologies into Banking, Trnsaction services and  FINTECH solutions will enable organizations to leverage the potential of blockchain technology, enhancing security, transparency, and efficiency in financial transactions and services.

- **Blockchain Platforms:** Core blockchain platforms like Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, or Corda, which serve as the foundation for developing smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps).

**Smart Contracts:** Self-executing contracts written in programming languages like Solidity (for Ethereum) or Go (for Hyperledger Fabric) to automate business processes and transactions on the blockchain.

**Consensus Mechanisms:** Algorithms for achieving consensus among nodes in a distributed network, such as Proof of Work (PoW) in Bitcoin or Proof of Stake (PoS) in Ethereum 2.0.

**Digital Wallets:** Secure software applications or hardware devices used to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies and manage private keys.

**Decentralized Identity (DID):** Technologies that enable individuals and entities to own and control their identities on the blockchain, such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials.

**Cryptographic Algorithms:** Encryption and hashing algorithms like SHA-256 and RSA, used for securing transactions and data on the blockchain.

**Interoperability Protocols:** Technologies that facilitate communication and data exchange between different blockchain networks and platforms. Polkadot, Cosmos and Wanchain.

**Oracles:** Middleware that connects the blockchain to external data sources, enabling smart contracts to interact with real-world data. Chainlink, Band Protocol and Tellor.

**Token Standards:** Protocols like ERC-20 (for fungible tokens) and ERC-721 (for non-fungible tokens) used for creating and managing tokenized assets on the blockchain.

**Security Measures:** Technologies to ensure the security of blockchain networks, including Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection, Multi-Signature (Multi-Sig) wallets, and Auditing tools.

**Privacy Solutions:** Techniques like Zero-Knowledge Proofs and Confidential Transactions to enhance privacy in blockchain transactions.

**Scalability Solutions:** Technologies such as Sharding, Layer 2 solutions (e.g., Lightning Network), and Sidechains to improve the scalability of blockchain networks.

#### Keywords
  
   - Bit coin - It is the first cryptocurrency, and a decentralized form of digital cash that eliminates the need for traditional intermediaries like banks and governments to make financial transactions. Is basically a computer file which is stored in a 'digital wallet' app on a smartphone or computer.
  
  - Crypto currency - Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.
  
  - Decentralization - each member of the blockchain structure has access to the whole distributed database. As opposed to the central-based system, consensus algorithm allows for control of the network
  
  - Solidity - It is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Solidity was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
  
  - Ethereum - It is an open-source, blockchain-based, decentralized software platform used for its own cryptocurrency, ether. It enables SmartContracts and Distributed Applications (ĐApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party
  
  - Smart Contracts - These are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.  It is an IT protocol that simplifies transfers of digital assets between parties in compliance with agreed terms or conditions by defining rules and sanctions around the agreement. It is similar to a traditional contract in most cases, except that it can also automatically enforce the agreed obligations. With Blockchain technology, intelligent contracts are increasingly used.
  
  - Buidler (replacement for Truffle) - Bills itself as a "task runner for Ethereum smart contract developers". In practice, this means that the tool will help you bootstrap your Solidity project with a template and give you all the scaffolding needed to test out your smart contracts and ultimately deploy onto the Ethereum blockchain.
  
  - Ethers.js -  A Javascript SDK for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.  It has all the necessary functions for working with wallets, accounts, and contracts, and it also has some neat utilities such as ABICoder, HDNode, BigNumber, and various formatting utilities for hex strings, ether units, and Etherum addresses.
  
  - Ethereum Waffle -  A lightweight test runner for Ethereum smart contracts. Has testing utils built in like Chai matchers for Ethereum addresses, hashes, and BigNumbers, it's Typescript native, and plays well with Ethers.
  
  - ICO (Initial Coin Offerings) -  It is the cryptocurrency industry’s equivalent to an initial public offering (IPO). Interested investors can buy into the offering and receive a new cryptocurrency token issued by the company. This token may have some utility in using the product or service the company is offering, or it may just represent a stake in the company or project. A company looking to raise money to create a new coin, app, or service launches an ICO as a way to raise funds.
 
  - Node  user or computer within the blockchain architecture (each has an independent copy of the whole blockchain ledger)
  
- Transaction - smallest building block of a blockchain system (records, information, etc.) that serves as the purpose of blockchain

- Block - a data structure used for keeping a set of transactions which is distributed to all nodes in the network

- Chain - a sequence of blocks in a specific order

- Miners - specific nodes which perform the block verification process before adding anything to the blockchain structure

- Consensus (consensus protocol) - a set of rules and arrangements to carry out blockchain operations

- Immutability - any records made in a blockchain cannot be changed or deleted

 - Provenance - refers to the fact that it is possible to track the origin of every transaction inside the blockchain ledger

- Anonymity- each blockchain network participant has a generated address, not user identity. This keeps users' anonymity, especially in a public blockchain structure

- Transparency - the blockchain system cannot be corrupted. This is very unlikely to happen, as it requires huge computing power to overwrite the blockchain network completely

- Oraclize  - provides a way to get outside data from any web API onto the blockchain. To use it, you'll use Oraclize's smart contracts to send a query to Oraclize with your API call. Once they get a result from the API, they call a function named __callback in your smart contract and pass it the result as an input.

- ABI (Application Binary Interface) - The interface is the de facto method for encoding/decoding data into/out of the machine code. In Ethereum, it's basically how you can encode Solidity contract calls for the EVM and, backwards, how to read the data out of transactions.

- Compiled Contract -  The contract converted to byte-code to run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), adhering to the specification. The function names and input parameters are hashed during compilation. Therefore, for another account to call a function, it must first be given the funtion name and arguments - hence the ABI.

- EVM is essential to the Ethereum Protocol and is instrumental to the consensus engine of the Ethereum system. It allows anyone to execute code in a trustless ecosystem in which the outcome of an execution can be guaranteed and is fully deterministic (i.e) executing smart contracts.

- ASP - It is the membership token of the AirSwap decentralized exchange. The AirSwap (ASP) Token provides the right to signal your intention to trade one cryptocurrency. AirSwap combines on-chain and off-chain networks to create a secure and stable environment for trading and financial payments.

- Cryptocurrencies:   
 
 1. Bitcoin (BTC)

 2. Ethereum (ETH)

 3. Ripple (XRP)

 4. EOS (EOS)
 
 5. Bitcoin Cash (BCH)
 
 6. Litecoin (LTC) 

 7. Chainlink (LINK)
