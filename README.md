# Blockchain

Crypto Currency and decentralised networking.

By storing data across its network, the blockchain eliminates the risks that come with data being held centrally.

Its network lacks centralized points of vulnerability that computer hackers can exploit. Today’s internet has security problems that are familiar to everyone. We all rely on the “username/password” system to protect our identity and assets online. Blockchain security methods use encryption technology.

With Blockchain, users to the network have private keys and the network stores public keys for encryption/decryption when called upon.
