# Blockchain

Crypto Currency and decentralised networking.

By storing data across its network, the blockchain eliminates the risks that come with data being held centrally.

Its network lacks centralized points of vulnerability that computer hackers can exploit. Today’s internet has security problems that are familiar to everyone. We all rely on the “username/password” system to protect our identity and assets online. Blockchain security methods use encryption technology.

With Blockchain, users to the network have private keys and the network stores public keys for encryption/decryption when called upon.

## Keywords
  
   - bit coin - It is the first cryptocurrency, and a decentralized form of digital cash that eliminates the need for traditional intermediaries like banks and governments to make financial transactions. Is basically a computer file which is stored in a 'digital wallet' app on a smartphone or computer.
  
  - crypto currency - Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that is secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend.
  
  - decentralization - each member of the blockchain structure has access to the whole distributed database. As opposed to the central-based system, consensus algorithm allows for control of the network
  
  - solidity - It is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. Solidity was influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
  
  - ethereum - It is an open-source, blockchain-based, decentralized software platform used for its own cryptocurrency, ether. It enables SmartContracts and Distributed Applications (ĐApps) to be built and run without any downtime, fraud, control, or interference from a third party
  
  - smart contracts - These are programs which govern the behaviour of accounts within the Ethereum state.
  
  - Buidler (replacement for Truffle) - Bills itself as a "task runner for Ethereum smart contract developers". In practice, this means that the tool will help you bootstrap your Solidity project with a template and give you all the scaffolding needed to test out your smart contracts and ultimately deploy onto the Ethereum blockchain.
  
  - Ethers.js -  A Javascript SDK for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain.  It has all the necessary functions for working with wallets, accounts, and contracts, and it also has some neat utilities such as ABICoder, HDNode, BigNumber, and various formatting utilities for hex strings, ether units, and Etherum addresses.
  
  - Ethereum Waffle -  A lightweight test runner for Ethereum smart contracts. Has testing utils built in like Chai matchers for Ethereum addresses, hashes, and BigNumbers, it's Typescript native, and plays well with Ethers.
  
  - ICO (Initial Coin Offerings) -  It is a popular fundraising method used primarily by startups wishing to offer products and services, usually related to the cryptocurrency and blockchain space. The cryptocurrency industry’s equivalent to an initial public offering (IPO).
  
  - Node - user or computer within the blockchain architecture (each has an independent copy of the whole blockchain ledger)
  
- Transaction - smallest building block of a blockchain system (records, information, etc.) that serves as the purpose of blockchain

- Block - a data structure used for keeping a set of transactions which is distributed to all nodes in the network

- Chain - a sequence of blocks in a specific order

- Miners - specific nodes which perform the block verification process before adding anything to the blockchain structure

- Consensus (consensus protocol) - a set of rules and arrangements to carry out blockchain operations

- immutability - any records made in a blockchain cannot be changed or deleted

 - provenance - refers to the fact that it is possible to track the origin of every transaction inside the blockchain ledger

- anonymity- each blockchain network participant has a generated address, not user identity. This keeps users' anonymity, especially in a public blockchain structure

- transparency - the blockchain system cannot be corrupted. This is very unlikely to happen, as it requires huge computing power to overwrite the blockchain network completely
